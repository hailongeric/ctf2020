To make it even more fun, we hid the flag inside this maze.

Hint1: "If you get lost in a maze, sometimes it helps to trace your own steps."

Hint2: "We hid the flag inside the binary, not in a graphical representation."

Hint3: "It's not only about the goal, but also about the decisions you made long the way!"

Hint4: "It's a rev challenge - have you looked at the disassembly?"
